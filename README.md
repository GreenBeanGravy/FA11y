# FA11y
FA11y is a tool that aims to make many important GUI elements of Fortnite accessible to blind players. As of now, FA11y has the ability to provide simple directions to POIs, it can read your Health, Shield, and the Rarity of weapons, and it can even place a ping on the center of the storm to help you navigate.
